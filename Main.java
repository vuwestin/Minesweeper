		 * Things to note about this application:
		 * Currently the image variables are made with my set directories for my desktop,
		 * I have included the picture files if you want to download them and change the file location in my code
		 * 
		 * THIS IS WINDOWS ONLY
		 * I have tried it on my macbook and the jbuttons were made weird, but have 
		 * tested my program on 3 windows desktops(All Windows 10) and all have worked as intended.
		 * 
		 * I have never saved a .java file in my life so if there are errors with that please let me know
		 * 
		 * The files are currently in a java package called "yee"
		 * My eclipse .java files only work if in a package that is not default
		 * 
		 *
