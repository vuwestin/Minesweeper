# Minesweeper
CPSC 223J Final Project

This application only works in Windows as the JButtons used are displayed differently on macOS.

The classic game remade in Java as part of my CPSC223J class. The application includes an intro screen where the player can select desired dimensions and mine count for the game, along with the usual features of Minesweeper.
